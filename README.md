cmpm_163_lab3
For the first cube on the left, I used a mesh normal material, because it looks nice. For the middle one I used the basic phong material as was specified. For the third cube on the right I ussed the example shader  that was given in the assignment. 
For the last cube on the top I took the sin of the x pos and the cos of the y coord of each vertex and did  gl_FragColor = vec4(y, x, x/y, 1.0);
