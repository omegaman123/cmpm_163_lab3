For the first cube on the left, I used a mesh normal material, because it looks nice. 

For the middle one I used the basic phong material as was specified with the green specular.

For the third cube on the right I ussed the example shader that was given in the assignment and interpolated between a light and dark purple. 

For the last cube on the top I took the sin of the x pos and the cos of the y coord of each vertex and did  gl_FragColor = vec4(y, x, x/y, 1.0); to interpolate between red and white.
